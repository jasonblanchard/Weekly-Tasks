A few bash scripts that add weekly tasks to a file from a unix/Linux command line and email the content to you and/or your supervisor. â€” Read more

Put these files in ~/reports. The progam will aggregate all your weekly reports here as well as the two bash scripts.

wk.sh allows you to add tasks from the command line. Add a link to this file called wk to ~/bin and update $PATH (log out and back in) so you can run it with the wk command. It will accept all subsequent arguments as input. For example:

$ wk "Created a script for weekly tasks"

will output:

- Created a script for weekly tasks

 to a file called [week_number]_reports. It will create this file if it doesn't already exist.

weeklyreports.sh will email the contents of the current week's report file. Add the email address as an argument to specify the recipient. 

The program needs mail-utils as a dependency. You may need to edit the scripts a bit so they show the right information (such as your name!).

Add weeklyreports.sh to a cron job to have the task email automatically sent. 

$ contab -e

will allow you to edit your crontab file. Add the script at your desired time. For example: 

# email list to me every day at 4:30 as a backup
30 16 * * * /home/[username]/reports/emailreport.sh [youremailaddress]

# email to supervisor every Friday at 4:45
45 16 * * 5 /home/[your username]/reports/emailreport.sh [otheremailaddress]
